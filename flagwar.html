                        <h4>How Does FlagWar Work?:</h4>
                        <p style="text-indent:20px">
                            <em>Nation A</em> decides that <em>Nation B</em> sucks. <em>Nation A's King</em> declares
                            them to be enemies using Towny's <code>/nation enemy add [Nation_B]</code> command.
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-indent:20px">
                            The Residents of <em>Nation A</em> can now attack any of the Towns within <em>Nation B</em>.
                            In order to attack, Residents first need to obtain some <em>oak fence posts</em>
                            (configurable) so that they can plant their <em>War Flag</em> and dispute the plot(s) of
                            <em>Nation B</em> as their own.
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-indent:20px">
                            The flag&#8209;bearer is the Player who will be placing the War Flag. When the plot has been
                            won over, the plot will be claimed as part of the flag&#8209;bearer’s Town (so make sure
                            they have extra plots available to claim).
                        </p>

                        <h4>Attacking:</h4>
                        <ul style="margin-left:5%; margin-right:5%">
                            <li>You cannot attack if you are a Server Operator (OP).</li>
                            <li>You cannot attack a Nation that is Neutral / Peaceful.</li>
                            <li>You cannot attack while being in a Neutral Nation.</li>
                            <li>You can only attack the border plots of enemy Towns. (configurable)</li>
                            <li>You can only place flags on the surface. They sky should not be obstructed.</li>
                            <li>Therefore, you cannot place flags in worlds with a ceiling. (E.g. Nether worlds)</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p style="text-indent:20px">
                            You also cannot attack a Nation with less Players online than defined by the
                            <code>player_limits.min_online_in_nation</code> config node, and the Town you’re attacking
                            must have more online Players than defined by <code>player_limits.min_online_in_Town</code>.
                            These same requirements are in place for your nation as well, so both parties must meet the
                            minimum Player requirements. This is so that the target can retaliate as well as know what’s
                            going on.
                        </p>

                        <p style="text-indent:20px">
                            Attacking a Nation will automatically add your Nation to defenders' enemies list. This
                            allows for the defending Nation to retaliate immediately without waiting for their king or
                            assistants to come online.
                        </p>

                        <p style="text-indent:20px">
                            Towny will automatically place a Timer Block for the flag (traditionally, a colored wool
                            block), as well as a light source on top. In the sky you will notice a large beacon so that
                            the defenders know where to go. The wool will animate from green to red as time progresses.
                            After the wool has gone red, the attacker will have held out long enough that they win the
                            area.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Defending:</h4>
                        <p style="text-indent:20px">
                            Once an enemy attack has started, you'll want to route it quickly. Take note of the global
                            chat, as <em>Towny Plot Coordinates</em> will have been broadcast to the whole server. Use
                            whatever means you can to make your way there. You can use <code>/towny map</code> to see
                            your current coordinates.
                        </p>

                        <p style="text-indent:20px">
                            Once near the coordinates, you can start to scan the sky for a war beacon and make your way
                            to it. (It's a floating cube, and it won't always render.) The <em>War Flag</em> will be on
                            the surface. Kill your enemies and make your way to their flag. Destroy the Timer Block (the
                            block above the fence post) to cancel the attack.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Economic Costs:</h4>
                        <ul style="margin-left:5%; margin-right:5%">
                            <li>
                                Attacking comes at a cost. Whenever a player places a flag, they are charged a staking
                                fee. The player is also checked for if they can afford the repercussions of a successful
                                or failed attack.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Whenever a Defender breaks the flag, the Attacker is forced to pay an additional fee to
                                the defending Town.
                            </li>
                            <li>There are different charges for both Home blocks and normal plots.</li>
                            <li>
                                The charges can be either a pillage fee, where the Defending Town pays the
                                flag&#8209;bearer, or it will be a rebuilding cost where the flag&#8209;bearer must pay
                                the Town under attack. This offers a couple of different modes of play.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    
                        <h4>Further Notes:</h4>
                        <ul style="margin-left:5%; margin-right:5%">
                            <li>
                                While the <em>war flag</em> is under dispute, block permissions are changed. However,
                                depending on the server setup, you might not gain full destruction capabilities until
                                after the plot has been won.
                            </li>
