                    <p>
                        Event War was originally built into Towny, but suffered many shorfalls, such as not being
                        persistant. Event War is now available as a separate plugin, with many new features.
                    </p>
    		        <p>
                        Event War includes 5 war types, is hyper-configurable, is lore-packed and can be simple fun
                        or configured to have lasting outcomes. Wars can be initiated by player or admins. 
                    </p>
    		        <p>
                        Event War is currently in closed-beta, with downloads being made available to Sponsors of LlmDl,
                        who has spent many, many hours on the EventWar revamp.

                <!-- FlagWar -->

                    <h5 style="text-align:center">FlagWar</h5>
                    <hr>
                    <p>
                        FlagWar was originally included in Towny, and later forked to it's own add-on plugin. It's one
                        of the oldest war systems for Towny, dating back to 2011. FlagWar is a <em>Nation Vs Nation</em>
                        war system, and is fought on a <em>plot-by-plot</em> basis.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        FlagWar often involves multiple fronts, and can be very punishing in regards to Towns suffering
                        tremendous losses of territorial control. Limitations for having a minimum number of online
                        players from all parties can help prevent Towns from being completely steam-rolled.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Typically, FlagWar is operational 24/7. Having admins schedule dedicated 'armistice days', by
                        setting <code>rules.allow_attacks: false</code> and then restarting the server, also gives
                        players some time to rebuild and recover resources.
                    </p>

                <!-- Siege War -->

                    <h5 style="text-align:center">Siege War</h5>
                    <hr>
    		        <p>
                        Siege War is available as a separate plugin, allowing for player-enabled, multi-day long Sieges.
                    </p>
    		        <p>
                        Sieges are conducted by Nations on Towns resulting in a geo-political battle for influential
                        territorial control. Sieges are non-destructive of town lands and only come with monetary
                        punishments, negated with the Towny Bankruptcy system.
                    </p>
    		        <p>
                        Siege War also supports 'casual' and 'cross-timezone' player bases. Each siege is typically of a
                        moderate duration (e.g. 3 days), which has the advantage of allowing both 'dedicated' and
                        'casual/cross-timezone' players to become involved and contribute meaningfully to most wars.

                        A simple plugin that provides arcade wars with your Towny plugin. The author of the plugin is
                        karlov_m.
                        TownyWars is a fairly new plugin, but it is already able to provide simple, and most importantly
                        interesting wars between towns.
                    </p>

                    <h6>How it works</h6>
                    <p>
    		            There are neutral towns and non-neutral ones. Only non-neutral cities can declare war. After the
                        Declaration of war, both cities have points that are calculated from the number of citizens.
                        When a citizen from one city is killed by a citizen from another, one point is taken away from
                        the town of the victim and transferred to the attacking city. During the war, both towns cannot
                        turn off the PvP.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The winner gets the entire territory of the losing town. Other towns can join the war as allies
                        of one of the parties.
                    </p>
                </div>

                        BetterTownyWars provides new mechanics for letting your players to fight between their nations
                        with rewards for the winner, allowing them to be neutral too.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Wars can be declared by a player if he/she has permissions. The plugin actually supports two
                        types of war, and the winner earns a certain amount of money from the other nation bank.

                            Nation vs Nation:<br>Two nations against each other and the first one to kill a certain %

                    <p>
                        A war can be ended if all of their members send a peace request or when it reaches the maximum
                        duration time (disabled at the moment).
